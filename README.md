# RealTime-Tracker
This is a backend project based on Node-Express-EJS-socket.io...I used Leaflet JS to add the map feature in it

before starting, through cmd/powershell install node modules,package-json using "npm init", followed by "npm i express ejs nodemon" and finally to install socket.io "npm i socket.io"

<b>HAPPY CODING!</b>
